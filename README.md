# Smart-BIn
Smart Bin was the project developed in order to preserve the environment and also save millions of dollars spent in order to do so.The project was developed using an Arduino Board and Computer Vision. Basically the task was to implement a way to enable people dispose waste  in a proper manner.As we see a lot many people putting non-recyclable waste into recyclable bins and recyclable waste into thrash,we developed a solution to avoid this issue.The developed prototype is known as Smart Bin ,it is the combination of Computer Vision with a simple arduino board attached with motors,which in turn are attached to lids of the garbage bins.For building this prototype we used the camera of the laptop as the "eye" of our prototype.The camera of the laptop acts as a first point of contact in the system.As soon as the person walks up to the camera with waste in hand it automatically open the bin in which the garbage needs to be disposed. Using certain classification techniques the garbage can be classified into recyclable and non-recyclable,thus opening the optimal bin.
